## Overview

Weaving is a craft with a long history in many places around the world, including the Pacific NorthWest. Woven baskets in particular have long been important practical and cultural objects for BC Coast Salish people. An important feature of woven baskets is the occurrence of beautiful geometric motifs/patterns, such as the ones of the three baskets below, exposed at the [UBC Museum of Anthropology](https://moa.ubc.ca/)

The work described here stems from a starting collaboration betwen the [Department of Mathematics](http:/math.sfu.ca) at [Simon Fraser University (SFU)](http://www.sfu.ca) and the [Tla'amin Nation](http://www.tlaaminnation.com). 

Our work consisted in the development of a series of interactive [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) allowing to reproduce patterns observed on existing woven baskets but also to create novel patterns. Our notebooks are primarily intended to be used by students during classrooms activities, with the goal to illustrate how simple geometric concepts and operations can be used to design realistic patterns; our hope is that our notebooks can also be useful to artist weavers, by allowing them to visualize different pattern ideas.
